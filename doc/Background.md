## Background

SOLSTREAM is a Decentralized Streaming Service in the Solana (SOL) Ecosystem.

### Motivation

Just as the NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox and other television networks, and streaming services such as YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, there will be blockchain-based television and streaming networks, streaming thousands of macro- and micro-channels and content on Web 3.0, curated by the platforms and/or produced by creators.
Our project aims to develop the design and prototype of a television network, which runs on Web 3.0 and records contracts and other data openly on the Solana (SOL) blockchain network.
The SOLSTREAM project integrates multiple blockchain project categories, namely NFT, DAO, streaming video, and e-commerce, under a single operational framework, and implements this novel framework as a working on-demand video streaming dapp.

### Benchmark with Competing Technologies/Platforms:

The following figure shows the benchmarks to the project:

![Benchmark](./img/Slide09.png) 

The following is a discussion of each benchmarked technology/platform, as some of the shortcomings of the existing technologies/platforms are to be resolved by SOLSTREAM:

**Streaming Services** 
- Built around on-demand video rather than live streaming, decisions/transactions not transparent, curation not democratized
	
**YouTube**
- Centralized, most of the profit goes to YouTube, advertisement exits but transactions not transparent, decisions/transactions not transparent,  while curation is democretized censoring rules are not transparent, YouTube's actions have significantly affected cryptocurrency content creators

**Television Networks**
- Centralized, decisions/transactions not transparent, curation not democratized

**Satellite Networks**
- Centralized, decisions/transactions not transparent, curation not democratized

**Theta Network**
- [https://www.thetatoken.org/](https://www.thetatoken.org/)
- Focuses on streaming, where there is no advertisement currently, very few (around 30-40) [streams](https://www.theta.tv/discover/streams) despite many years of presence, Theta ecosystem may change many things for the better.

**Media Industry Licensing Content**
[https://www.milc.global/](https://www.milc.global/)
- Tokenizing the media assets, but no advertisement aspects.
- Welt Der Wunder TV’s Media Content Library was valued by Ernst & Young at €48,000,000 in November 2020.
